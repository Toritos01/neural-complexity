Hello yes this is dog.
The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany.
Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.
The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along with a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under large, thick basalt blocks.
The dog had died of canine distemper.
Earlier remains dating back to 30,000 years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late Pleistocene.
